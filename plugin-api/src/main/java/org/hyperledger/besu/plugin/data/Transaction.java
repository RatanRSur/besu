 * A transaction is a single cryptographically-signed instruction constructed by an actor externally

 * <p>There are two types of transactions: those which result in message calls and those which
 * result in the creation of new accounts with associated code (known informally as ‘contract
 * creation’). Message call transactions will have an address present in the {@link #getTo} method
